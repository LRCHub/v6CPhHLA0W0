And i love you so, the people ask me how, how i've lived till now, i tell them i dont
i guess they understand how lonely life has been
but life began again the day you took my hand

And yes i know how lonely life can be, the shadows follow
me, and the night wont set me free, but i don't let the evening bring me down, now your around me.

And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me, you set
my spirit free, i'm happy that you do, the book of life is brief,
and once a page is read, all but love is dead, that is my belief.
And yes i know how loveless life can be, the shadows follow me, and the night wont set me free, but i don't let the
evening bring me down, now that your around me.
And i love you so.
