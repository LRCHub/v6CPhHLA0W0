*希望能和您成为朋友*
And I love you so.
The people ask me how.
How Ive lived till now.
I tell them I dont know.
I guess they understand.
How lonely life has been.
But life began again.
The day you took my hand.
And yes I know.
How lonely(loveless)life can be.
The shadows follow me.
And the night wont set me free.
But I dont let the evening.
Get(Bring)me down.
Now that youre around me.
And you love me too.
Your thoughts are just for me.
You set my spirit free. Im happy that you do.
The book of life is brief. And once a page is read.

All but love is dead that is my belief.

And yes I know.
How lonely(loveless)life can be.
The shadows follow me.
And the night wont set me free.
But I dont let the evening.
Get(Bring)me down.
Now that youre around me.

And I love you so. The people ask me how.
How ive lived till now. I tell them I dont know.
